#Total cards are 52 , therefore each deck has 13 cards each.
#probabilty of drawing any specific suit is 13/52 or 1/4
#probability of drawing a card from that same suit will be 12/51 as 1 card is already taken
#probability of each suit will be 13/52 * 12/51
#As there are 4 suits in a deck, therefore total probability is 4 * 13/52 * 12/51
