A Poisson distribution is the probability distribution that results from a Poisson experiment.
Attributes of a Poisson Experiment
A Poisson experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:
The experiment results in outcomes that can be classified as successes or failures.
The average number of successes (μ) that occurs in a specified region is known.
The probability that a success will occur is proportional to the size of the region.
The probability that a success will occur in an extremely small region is virtually zero.
Poisson Formula. Suppose we conduct a Poisson experiment, in which the average number of successes within a given region is μ. Then, the Poisson probability is:
P(x; μ) = (e-μ) (μx) / x!


Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.
In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.
