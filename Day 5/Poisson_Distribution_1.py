#A Poisson Process meets the following criteria (in reality many phenomena modeled as #Poisson processes donâ€™t meet these exactly):
#Events are independent of each other. The occurrence of one event does not affect the #probability another event will occur.
#The average rate (events per time period) is constant.
#Two events cannot occur at the same time.
