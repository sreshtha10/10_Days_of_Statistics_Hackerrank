Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean), or expected value. A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the average.
A high standard deviation means that the numbers are more spread out.
Steps to find Standard Deviation:
Step 1: Find the mean.
Step 2: For each data point, find the square of its distance to the mean.
Step 3: Sum the values from Step 2.
Step 4: Divide by the number of data points.
Step 5: Take the square root.


A quartile is a statistical term describing a division of observations into four defined intervals based upon the values of the data and how they compare to the entire set of observations. 
Q1: The first quartile is the middle number between the smallest number in a data set and its median.
Q2: The second quartile is the median ( percentile) of the data set.
Q3: The third quartile is the middle number between a data set's median and its largest number.
We will split the data into two halves, lower half and upper half:
If there are an odd number of data points in the original ordered data set, do not include the median (the central value in the ordered list) in either half.
If there are an even number of data points in the original ordered data set, split this data set exactly in half.
The value of the first quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half and the value of the third quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half.

Interquartile range:
  It is the difference between the third and the first quartile
